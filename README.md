# QSIprep Gear

This gear runs [QSIprep](https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/) on
[BIDS-curated data](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

For a description of what QSIprep does, read the
[official documentation](https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/).  

This gear runs the official
[`pennbbl/qsiprep:0.15.1` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pennbbl/qsiprep)

__Note__: `DOCKER_HUB` var in `.gitlab-ci.yml` has changed to `false`. By default, this
should be set to `true`

## Overview

[FAQ](#faq)

### Summary

`qsiprep` configures pipelines for processing diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. The main
features of this software are:

  1. A BIDS-app approach to preprocessing nearly all kinds of modern diffusion MRI data.
  2. Automatically generated preprocessing pipelines that correctly group, distortion correct,
     motion correct, denoise, coregister and resample your scans, producing visual reports
     and QC metrics.
  3. A system for running state-of-the-art reconstruction pipelines that include algorithms
     from Dipy_, MRTrix_, `DSI Studio`_  and others.
  4. A novel motion correction algorithm that works on DSI and random q-space sampling schemes

Description of workflow

1. Upload file to container
1. Select file as input to gear
1. Gear places output in Analysis
