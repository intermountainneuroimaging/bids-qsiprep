description = "BIDS qsiprep 0.0.1_0.15.1 \n qsiprep configures pipelines for processing diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. The main features of this software are:\n\nA BIDS-app approach to preprocessing nearly all kinds of modern diffusion MRI data.\n\nAutomatically generated preprocessing pipelines that correctly group, distortion correct, motion correct, denoise, co-register and resample your scans, producing visual reports and QC metrics.\n\nA system for running state-of-the-art reconstruction pipelines that include algorithms from Dipy, MRTrix, DSI Studio and others.\n\nA novel motion correction algorithm that works on DSI and random q-space sampling schemes"
